# Hyperline

Hyperline is a dedicated billing platform designed specifically for B2B SaaS companies, streamlining their billing processes in a unified interface. It is the best alternative to Chargebee, Recurly, or Stripe Billing for companies that need to handle billing logics, simple or complex.

## What We Do

Our billing platform seamlessly integrates with your existing business stack and offers both API and no-code integration solutions to automate your processes and data flows.

Hyperline allows you to:

- Manage several pricing models all at once (even complex ones)
- Manage products and associated prices in a product catalog (customizable by country and currency)
- Automatically generate invoices compliant with international regulations
- Integrate with external tools (CRM, ERP) through our API or with no-code tools like [Zapier](https://doc.hyperline.co/docs/zapier)
- Provide hosted checkout pages and a subscription management page to your customers
- Manage your customer base, synchronize with your existing tools
- Work with a wide range of tools, from no-code to deeper tech integration

<warning>
Hyperline is a **billing platform**, not to be confused with a **Payment Service Provider** (PSP) such as Paypal or Stripe. PSPs offer a range of services related to online payments and transactions, while Hyperline simplifies the billing process. We do not process or enable payments, but we offer simple ways for you to connect with your PSP in Hyperline.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Invoices must have unique ID numbers, and these numbers should follow a sequential order. This is a legal requirement that applies internationally. Hyperline lets you however choose the invoice number format.

</aside>

The {number} variable is mandatory. You can then add the year variable {YYYY}, the month variable {MM} and/or the day variable {DD} to customize the invoice number format. 

Depending on your choice, it will look like this:

| Variable | Invoice number format |
| --- | --- |
| {number} | 1 |
| {number}{YYYY} | 1-2023 |
| {number}{YYYY}{MM} | 1-2023-10 |
| {number}{YYYY}{MM}{DD} | 1-2023-10-10 |
| {YYYY}{MM}{DD}-00{number} | 2023-10-10-001 |

### Next invoice number

Do you already have an invoicing history?

If you do, we encourage you to have a look at the number of last invoice you sent, and to indicate this number +1 as the **next invoice number**. This way, you will keep a sequential order between your invoices while transitioning to Hyperline.

### Legal information

As legal requirements vary from country to country, and are sometimes industry-specific, we leave a space for you to add any relevant legal information to your invoices.

Check-in with your legal and accounting teams if needed to make sure you include all necessary information here. It can go from tax specificities to penalties applied if the invoice is not paid on time, to anything else.

Click on **Continue** when you are ready.
